# recipes-CSE2050
Created a branch for each of us for individual version control (if/as needed)
and main branch for merged code

Current Issues: 
1. search bar text should reset when reset button clicked
2. isnt search supposed to include descriptions and ingredients?
3. ensure pep 8 style - notably class names should be snake_case.py
4. comments where necesary
5. testing/ make sure everything is final
